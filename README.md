### Hi there 👋

I'm Siddhi — a BTech  student, currently exploring the world of **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** through hands-on projects.

- Learning core ML concepts with Python (scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)
- Interested in solving real-world problems using data
- Practicing **Java DSA** to build strong programming fundamentals
- Gradually growing my GitHub with clean, beginner-friendly ML projects

I'm passionate about learning by doing — experimenting, making mistakes, and improving every day.  
**Let’s build, learn, and make impact — one project at a time.**
